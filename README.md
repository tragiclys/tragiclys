## Tragiclys

She blooms in the hush where sorrow keeps its keys,

A lily of dusk folded from fragile light and memory,

Petals murmur of moments that could not stay,

Roots drink the soft, inevitable ache of day,

Beauty burns briefly, bows to the slow unmakingâ€”

**Tragiclys**

a luminous bloom that leaves the world remembering.
